### June 2017 - June 2022 | CAPP srl

From 2017 to 2022 I worked for [CAPP srl](https://capp.it/), a software house founded in Milan in 1973, which had historically dealt with software dedicated to the industry, in particular in the logistics and production field. In practice, from the warehouse control systems to the set of human-machine interfaces that allow personnel to monitor and control the plant integrating with CRMs, shipments, etc.

In CAPP I contributed to many projects for a variery of customers.
