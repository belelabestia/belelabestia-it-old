## Skills

Over the course of my carreer I've worked with a variety of technologies and developed many skills; I've also privately studied or experimented various programming languages, frameworks and some more theoretical/philosophical topics.

Here follows a brief summary of key topics that I've worked with, privately studied, or that I'd be interested in exploring more deeply.
