## Channels

I'm present on the following social media platforms as @belelabestia (Bel Ã¨ la Bestia) or @jasone_mb, but I don't post regularly on any of those; insomnia and spare time determine my publishing schedule. Most of my content is in italian.

- [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jasone-mb/): almost nothing at all.
- [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/belelabestia/): mostly personal content.
- [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@belelabestia): videos about coding, programming languages, work life and sometimes more personal or "pop" contents such as gaming or cinema.
- [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/belelabestia): same as YouTube, plus some written posts.
- [GitHub](https://github.com/belelabestia): mostly unfinished experiments in TypeScript and C#.
- [Personal website](https://belelabestia.it): this one right here.
