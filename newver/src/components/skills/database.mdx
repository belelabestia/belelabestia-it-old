### Database

I have to be honest, I never found a database engine able to fully convince me, so I'm still looking for something different. I never had the opportunity or the urgency to use one of the most famous NoSQL databases, but I know the main ones and I have a feel of how they work.

<Sqlite />
<Litedb />
<SqlServer />
<Postgresql />
