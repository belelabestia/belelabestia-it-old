### September 2022 - December 2022 | Buildo

From September to December 2022 I worked as a senior full-stack web developer for [Buildo](https://www.buildo.io/). Here I took part in the development of a small suite of web apps for Abbott, with the following stack:

- Frontend: React (TypeScript)
- Backend: Node (Express, tRPC)
- ORM: Prisma
- Database: PostgreSQL
- DevOps platform: GitHub
- Collaboration: G Suite, MS 365, Notion, Jira, Confluence, Slack

In buildo I had the opportunity to work in a larger team with more specialized roles (UI/UX, project management, testing, dev). We also integrated our artifacts in a larger platform build by other teams from the customer side.
