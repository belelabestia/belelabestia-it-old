### Frameworks

It is said that frameworks are the new languages, and in a sense that's true. Learning different architectural approaches to common problems is what gives the programmer a wide range of possibilities to represent domain and business logic.

#### WPF/UWP

In my early days in CAPP I worked with these two frameworks, but I've never been a fan of XAML.

#### ASP.NET

I've user this framework for most of my work and personal projects. I've played a little with Blazor and find WASM an opportunity to bring on web browsers many technologies that are by far stronger than JS-based ones.

#### Angular

Even if this is not the most liked frontend framework, I still find it the most powerful and complete development enviroment that I've ever worked with. That said, I've ascertained that having too many ways of accomplishing a task is not always the best choice for a dev team.

#### React

After years of experience on Angular, learning React was kind of a joke. In fact, I think the learning curve is the biggest strength of this UI rendering library. I'd call it a frontend framework, but let's be honest, that's not what it is. Anyways, along with React Router and a set of other libraries, it can also be used for real-world applications. I know Next.js fills this gap, but I've never used it.

#### Qwik

Despite being super young, this framework is already my favourite, and I bet it's going to be a game changer in the approach to web frontend technologies. The main goal of Qwik is to get completely rid of the hydration process, making web apps super fast and scalable and reducing the distance between frontend and backend rendering and development in general. Along with Qwik City (the Next.js of Qwik) it's really powerful and productive.
