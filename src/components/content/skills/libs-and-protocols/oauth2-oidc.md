#### OAuth2/OIDC

While I was in CAPP I wrote a library that implemented the OAuth 2.0 Authentication Code flow with PKCE because I was not fully convinced by the npm libraries that were available. This gave me the opportunity to implement a complex set of features, from the creation of cryptographically secure strings to the flow of redirects and validation steps, starting from the bare RFC description of the protocol.
