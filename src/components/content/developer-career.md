## Developer career

### June 2017 - June 2022 | CAPP srl

From 2017 to 2022 I worked for [CAPP srl](https://capp.it/), a software house founded in Milan in 1973, which had historically dealt with software dedicated to the industry, in particular in the logistics and production field. In practice, from the warehouse control systems to the set of human-machine interfaces that allow personnel to monitor and control the plant integrating with CRMs, shipments, etc.

In CAPP I contributed to many projects for a variery of customers.

#### Fater Group

I worked on a warehouse control system and many companion applications for [Fater Group](https://fatergroup.com/), one of the company's main customers with more than 20 years of collaboration.

As my first job in CAPP I took part to the creation of a brand new production and warehouse plant in Campochiaro. We built a set of software layers integrating both with the field (PLC) and the management (ERP) solutions provided by other companies.

My last work for CAPP was a complete rewrite in Angular of a huge set of features operating across all the core areas of the Fater main production and warehouse site in Pescara. It took 6 months only to complete the first tier (out of three) of higher priority features!

#### Scavolini

I contributed in creating and mantaining a set of UWP applications for Windows 10 handheld devices for [Scavolini](https://www.scavolini.com/). In the latest years in CAPP I worked also on mantaining and evolving the legacy software base that CAPP had built for this customer throughout more than a decade of collaboration.

#### Nippon Gases

I also worked as a consultant for [Consoft](https://consoftinformatica.it/) in [Rivoira (Nippon Gases Italia)](https://nippongases.com/it-it/nippon-gases/nippon-gases-italia); here I developed an advanced logging service working across many different middlewares (with both REST and SOAP APIs), with advanced payload and error serialization and the capability to replay the faulty calls in a diagnostic environment.

In Rivoira I worked mostly with ASP.NET Core and Entity Framework Core.

#### CAPPLite

I conceived and directed a branch of the company called CAPPLite; in concrete terms, it was a team of 4 people (including me). We made (they still make) progressive web apps, in the cloud and on site, in war and in peace, in industrial and office environments, in a perspective of product and service.

At CAPPLite I've used and mastered the following stack of technologies:

- Frontend: Angular (TypeScript)
- Backend: .NET Core/5+ (C#)
- ORM: Entity Framework Core
- Database: SQL Server, PostgreSQL
- DevOps platform: GitLab
- Collaboration: G Suite, MS 365

I've also studied, adopted and promoted an [agile](https://agilemanifesto.org/) approach to project management and operations:

- We worked without specific constraints of time and place, focusing exclusively on goals, preferring asynchronous exchange of information and work material.
- We preferred continuous and informal confrontation to the institution of rules of conduct.
- We preferred a constant, dynamic pursuit of virtuous practices and habits to the institution of rules and procedures.
- We were firmly convinced that transparency is the best way to conduct any type of human and professional relationship "in good times and bad".
- We were firmly convinced that every decision must be guided by information, with sincere scientific curiosity, and taken with the utmost pragmatism.
- We were firmly convinced that the duty of defining solutions should belong to the expert more than the client, just like the duty of establishing cures belongs to the doctor more than the patient.

#### Internal software

As a business branch providing modern web solutions, in CAPPLite we built internal tools that the whole company adopted.  
Here are the main ones:

- A super-lightweight tool for time and activity tracking and resource allocation, used by the employees.
- An internal ERP used by the administration, with accounting capabilities and customer and commission tracking functionality.
- The current CAPP Website.

### May 2021 - August 2022 | Aulab

While I was working in CAPP I wrote some articles on a variety of programming subjects for the [Aulab blog](https://aulab.it/cerca-nel-sito?q=marco+bellezza). Aulab is a coding hackademy that has helped more than ten thousand people to start their web development career with JavaScript and PHP.

### March 2022 - May 2022 | Private programming course

During my last few months in CAPP, I gave private tutoring in JavaScript programming basics. My course used material and examples from [javascript.info](https://javascript.info/), but I adopted a unique approach that I find more effective in creating good programmers. It consists in prioritizing architecture and design elements, such as types and naming, over control flow and language-specific constructs: in my experience the latter lead to a heavy procedural-centric, algorithm-based approach in coding in the early years of experience, and in the long run causes a poor understanding and embracing of the main practices that make code predictable, testable and mantainable.

### September 2022 - December 2022 | Buildo

From September to December 2022 I worked as a senior full-stack web developer for [Buildo](https://www.buildo.io/). Here I took part in the development of a small suite of web apps for Abbott, with the following stack:

- Frontend: React (TypeScript)
- Backend: Node (Express, tRPC)
- ORM: Prisma
- Database: PostgreSQL
- DevOps platform: GitHub
- Collaboration: G Suite, MS 365, Notion, Jira, Confluence, Slack

In buildo I had the opportunity to work in a larger team with more specialized roles (UI/UX, project management, testing, dev). We also integrated our artifacts in a larger platform build by other teams from the customer side.
