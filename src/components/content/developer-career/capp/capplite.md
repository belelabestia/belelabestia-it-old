#### CAPPLite

I conceived and directed a branch of the company called CAPPLite; in concrete terms, it was a team of 4 people (including me). We made (they still make) progressive web apps, in the cloud and on site, in war and in peace, in industrial and office environments, in a perspective of product and service.

At CAPPLite I've used and mastered the following stack of technologies:

- Frontend: Angular (TypeScript)
- Backend: .NET Core/5+ (C#)
- ORM: Entity Framework Core
- Database: SQL Server, PostgreSQL
- DevOps platform: GitLab
- Collaboration: G Suite, MS 365

I've also studied, adopted and promoted an [agile](https://agilemanifesto.org/) approach to project management and operations:

- We worked without specific constraints of time and place, focusing exclusively on goals, preferring asynchronous exchange of information and work material.
- We preferred continuous and informal confrontation to the institution of rules of conduct.
- We preferred a constant, dynamic pursuit of virtuous practices and habits to the institution of rules and procedures.
- We were firmly convinced that transparency is the best way to conduct any type of human and professional relationship "in good times and bad".
- We were firmly convinced that every decision must be guided by information, with sincere scientific curiosity, and taken with the utmost pragmatism.
- We were firmly convinced that the duty of defining solutions should belong to the expert more than the client, just like the duty of establishing cures belongs to the doctor more than the patient.
