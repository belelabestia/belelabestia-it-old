#### Internal software

As a business branch providing modern web solutions, in CAPPLite we built internal tools that the whole company adopted.  
Here are the main ones:

- A super-lightweight tool for time and activity tracking and resource allocation, used by the employees.
- An internal ERP used by the administration, with accounting capabilities and customer and commission tracking functionality.
- The current CAPP Website.
