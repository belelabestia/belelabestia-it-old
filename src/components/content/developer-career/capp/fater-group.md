#### Fater Group

I worked on a warehouse control system and many companion applications for [Fater Group](https://fatergroup.com/), one of the company's main customers with more than 20 years of collaboration.

As my first job in CAPP I took part to the creation of a brand new production and warehouse plant in Campochiaro. We built a set of software layers integrating both with the field (PLC) and the management (ERP) solutions provided by other companies.

My last work for CAPP was a complete rewrite in Angular of a huge set of features operating across all the core areas of the Fater main production and warehouse site in Pescara. It took 6 months only to complete the first tier (out of three) of higher priority features!
