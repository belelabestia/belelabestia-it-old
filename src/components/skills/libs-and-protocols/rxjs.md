#### RxJS

While I was trying to truly master Angular, I took the chance to get to master reactive programming and RxJS. I really like how this kind of programming make you think of a portion of the application state as a consequence of changes that happen over time. Observables make it possible to have immutable, declarative state in an object-oriented architecture.
