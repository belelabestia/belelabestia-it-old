### Languages

I love studying how languages and syntaxes mould how programmers think of the requirements and their actual implementation. I started by studying Clean Code by "Uncle Bob" for practical reasons and never stopped my research in this field.

#### JavaScript/TypeScript

I've used these two languages both backend and frontend side, mastering them over half a decade of experience. I have a profound knowledge of the powerful TypeScript type system, as well as a deep understanding of the features and constructs of the underlying language JavaScript.

#### C#

I've worked with C# for most of my carreer; I used it in backend web services as well as in command line tools. I worked with the Razor syntax in MVC projects too, and I made some personal experiments using C# in the frontend with Blazor.

#### C/C++

Even if I've never worked with these two languages, it's worth mentioning that I actually learned programming with them in my university years, while I was studying physics.

#### F#

This is a programming language that I'm really curious about. In particular it has some really innovative features like computation expressions, but I also like the powerful type system and the way it mixes FP static modules with proper OOP classes in a really synthetic syntax.

#### Haskell

This is a FP language that I've privately studied and that I'm very curious about. In a world of catch-all languages, I find its rigorous, pure, paradigm-oriented approach almost romantic.

#### Rust

I think Rust is overall the most promising language in the field at the moment. Its main peculiarity is the capability to grant memory and thread safety with low level performances. Rust has also an amazing community and a fast and complete toolchain. Although I'm not an expert with this language, I'd be really interested in working with it.

#### HTML/CSS

As a full-stack developer I just have to master HTML/CSS. I've worked a lot with flex and grid layouts and with UI toolkits, but I have to say, aesthetics is not really my biggest strength.

#### Markdown

I simply love the simplicity of this markup language.

#### SCSS/SASS

I used SCSS in a single but long work project, I wouldn't call myself an expert but I definitely see value in using this CSS extension to improve the organization and architecture of modular, customizable design systems.

#### T-SQL

I worked with this language but honestly, I see no reason for using procedural extensions of the SQL language. I worked with many monolithic database-centric backends at the very beginning of my career and I really disenjoyed the experience.
