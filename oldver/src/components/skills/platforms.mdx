### Platforms

#### .NET

This is by far the echosystem I've worked with the most. My dev career started in 2017 with .NET Framework, using WPF to build native Windows applications. At the time it was usual to query the database directly from the client, so I had few opportunities to use ASP.NET (and, alas, IIS) to build backend services. I started working with .NET Core starting from version 2.0 and I still keep up to date with the latest releases. I really love the new, rewritten framework and I've used it for many work and personal projects.

#### Node

Since my backend experience is mostly built on .NET projects, in the past I used Node mostly for trivial backend services. Lately I've been using Node with Express and tRPC in professional real-world projects, experiencing the tremendous benefit of having a single language to share data types and utilities all across a project that could include many backend services and different frontend apps.

#### Web browsers

Here I am, Captain Obvious. As a web developer I know how a web browser works. Having created a huge lot of tiny vanilla HTML5 projects, I know what's needed about DOM manipulation, Service Workers, and many other native JS APIs. I think this is worth mentioning just to enphasize the fact that I'm able to understand (and interested in studying) what the most common frontend frameworks are doing under the hood.

#### Docker

I'm not a DevOps expert, but I have definitely used docker a lot. I know the basics of docker and compose and I've used it in development and deployment contexts. Still in my opinion the use of this kind of abstraction layers over pure software packages is often an overkill in small projects.
