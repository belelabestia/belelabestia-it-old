#### Prisma

Lately I've been using this ORM, and I have to say, it's really powerful. However, I overall disliked the developer experience. It uses a dedicated language to declare the data model and you have to manually scaffold the TypeScript models and repositories every time you update the schema. Also, it generates only forward-migrations (that means, no easy migration rollbacks).
