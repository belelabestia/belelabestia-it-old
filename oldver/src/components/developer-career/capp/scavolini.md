#### Scavolini

I contributed in creating and mantaining a set of UWP applications for Windows 10 handheld devices for [Scavolini](https://www.scavolini.com/). In the latest years in CAPP I worked also on mantaining and evolving the legacy software base that CAPP had built for this customer throughout more than a decade of collaboration.
