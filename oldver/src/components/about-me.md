## About me

I'm a human being living in Italy, near Milan.  
I love music and technology, reading and writing, science and philosophy.

I listen to italian and american punk rock, drum and bass, jazz, electro swing, many different kinds of metal.  
I played guitar from the age of 6 till the age of 23 and singed for more than 10 years; back in the day I recorded 2 albums with 2 different bands; in the last years I've been playing the drums as a hobby.

I did PR for clubs, planned and organized parties, events and concerts, ran my own disco at 23 years old; it didn't go well. I reinvented myself first as an ICT consultant and then as a software developer. I'm a dynamic person and a fast learner. I put creativity at the service of reasoning and reasoning at the service of creativity.

Reading and writing saved my adolescence; Seneca, Epictetus, Marcus Aurelius saved my life.

Romantic relationships gave me clarity. I like women and prefer open relationships, absence of jealousy and trust-based bonds.

I have a long-standing, sustainable relationship with cannabis, which I've never hidden to anyone.

I'm a good money saver, a modest investor, an ambitious aspiring enterpreneur.

I left a safe job in a big structured company for a more adventurous job in a small software house; I envisioned, founded and ran the startup phase of a new business unit offering an up-to-date set of skills in modern web development in terms of technologies and practices, leading a process of innovation that positively affected the whole company and was vital to deal with the covid pandemic.

I decided to become a freelance developer because I felt the need for a wider exploration of new tecnologies and teams, expanding and growing my set of professional and human skills.

I'm a passionate student of coding, software architecture, programming languages, design patterns, project management, agile methodologies, digital transformations, human structures and organizations, politics and macroeconomics.

I may have many strong opinions about many subjects, but I have flaws too üòù‚Äã
